- Speech to text integrated in your computer; in any window or application.
- It transforms what you say into text, and pastes it and your current active cursor position (a text input where your mouse is located).

MVP for private use (Non Commercial).


Notes:
- In its default set up the program is made to run in Linux + Hyprland, implementation for windows is on the way; I can't test mac implementation. 
- You have to install google chrome (if you haven't installed it already) to make the program work.
A version that uses firefox or other browser will be (very) wellcome.

- The current behavior is that the program is always running in the background, so you don't have to use any shortcut to activate it (is already listening)
You can modify it and create another program version that does use a shortcut for activation (start to listening to transcript)


Instructions:
- Open terminal and go to project folder
- Activate environment (for windows): venv/Scripts/activate
- Install needed packages with: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run program with: python main.py
- Let terminal running (minimize if needed)
- Speak, see the text transcription of your speech at your active text input
- Control C (inside the terminal) to stop execution

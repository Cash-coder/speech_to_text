--- future improvements ---
- underline changes printed by grammar (gpt func) - important for typos!
- very good pronunciation api  (text to speech), that exaggerates a bit (gpt) (speechify has several voices with different accents gi)
- Capacity to train with that word or phrase
  - connect chatgpt api, ask: "Why do you think I've made that mistake and propose a trainning to improve" -> Creates training in real time through CLI
    - express the same but make it sound more standard american english
    - can i use some phrasal verb in this sentence ?
  - gpt api: make more concise, even (that spartan word for being extremely concise, laconic?)
    - say the same in different ways (to see variations)
    - CLI options: j = make a joke about it | Make it sound more funny | p = make it sound more professional (for a business environment)
  - multiprocessing ? ie: main process runs with only speech to text, ready for next input, while the others do the rest

 - For other language: When I read a book in half english + half spanish -> you learn when you understand (so first know what it means, then read it, repeat = patterns)
